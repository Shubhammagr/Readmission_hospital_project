Analyze factors related to readmission as well as other outcomes pertaining to patients in order to classify a patient-hospital outcome

3 different outputs:

1. No readmission

2. A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe your treatment was not appropriate);

3. A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last one, however, the reason could be the state of the patient.

## Main Objective

> **How effective was the treatment received in hospital?**

# Notebooks
**note:** I use plotly for make and interactive plots, but can be seen if you open the notebooks on github.

[1-readmited_preprocess.ipynb] - Data loading and cleaning

[2-readmited_data_explore.ipynb] - Data explore and analysis

[3-readmited_Models_imbalance.ipynb] (**Selected Model**) - Modeling with a imbalanced dataset.

**Modeling conclusions**

# Selected Measure

The selected evaluation metric is the 
> **Recall - Sensitivity**

A False Negative might delay more tests or treatment, 
however a False Positive may just lead to more tests or treatments – not as costly as putting a life at stake.

# Selected Model

the selected model is the result of process detailed in 3-readmited_Models_imbalance.ipynb

The model is saved in the models folder:

`NB_pipeline_imbalance_recall.joblib`

# Run Final Scripts

## Clean dataset
download and turn raw data from (../raw) into cleaned data ready to be transformed for data modeling
```bash     
python src/data/make_dataset.py
```

## Make data for machine learning modeling
transform data for machine learning
```bash
python src/features/build_features.py
```

## train machine learning model
```bash
python src/models/train_model.py
```

## evaluate machine learning model
```bash
python src/models/evaluation.py
```
## Unit testing

```bash
coverage run -m pytest; coverage report
```

# streamlit web app serving model



local:

```bash
streamlit run readmission_prediction_app.py
```
